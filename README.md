# kaggle-house-prices

This is my attempt at the Kaggle House Prices competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview.

To run my code, you will need to click the "Download All" button on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data and put the data into the `data/raw` directory.

The work for this was done using R3.6.
