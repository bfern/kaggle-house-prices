* Splines instead of linear effects in the regression model
* Interaction effects might work well to deal with similar covariates like the basement areas
* Tree based/clustering approach may help us capture non linear effects
* We may be able to do a better approach to deal with missing values, rather than just replace with the most common value
* Stacking the various approaches may be the way forward
* Other variables that I haven't yet used but could boost predictive power that are especially easy to add into a linear model are things like:
  - Near park
  - Central Heating
  - Roof Type
  - Swimming Pool/other misc features
